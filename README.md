Pwas
====

A small and naive webserver written in PHP. Do *not* use this in production; or on any public facing server - 
that would be a very bad idea. 

Requirements
------------
* PHP 5.3.\* 
  * pcntl
  * sockets

Examples
--------
You can run Examples/Hello.php like so:

    php Examples/Hello.php

Notes
-----
This whole thing is in a state of flux; I'm refacoring and changing things like mad.
